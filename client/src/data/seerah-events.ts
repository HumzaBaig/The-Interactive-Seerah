After nearly a month, Allah sent a fierce wind destroying the enemy camp, and they withdrew. The Quran declared: 'Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage' (33:25). Immediately after, the Prophet ﷺ besieged Banu Qurayza for 25 days until they surrendered. They chose Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, their former ally, to judge them. Sa'd, wounded and near death, ruled according to their own Torah law (Deuteronomy 20:12-14): the fighting men who committed treason were executed, while women and children were spared. The Prophet ﷺ said Sa'd had judged according to the judgment of Allah.",
